/*:
  ## Properties/ Data/ Formulae student needs:
 - **itemPrices**: An array containing prices of 7 (or any number of) items.
 - **totalAmount**: Total amount of all items before applying discount. (A single value.)
 - **discountPercentage**: A percentage discount number. For example: 5%, 10%.
 - **discountType**: Type of discount to be applied on an item. Discount types could be Default discount (5%), Thanksgiving discount (10%), Christmas discount (15%), New year discount (20%).
 - **discountedAmount**: Amount after applying discount on totalAmount. Formula: totalAmount * 0.5 (if a discount of 5% is applied).
 - **totalAmountAfterDiscount**: *total Amount - discountedAmount*.
*/

/*:
  ## Assignment 1:  Function
  Create a function with 2 parameters: totalAmount and discountPercentage (5%, 10% and so on).
  Calculate the discountedAmount and subtract this from the totalAmount (using formulae above).
  Return the totalAmountAfterDiscount.

  ## Assignment 2: Function
  Modify the function above to now take in a default discount percentage that will be applied by default to all.
  Hint: Use function overloading.

 ## Assignment 3: typealias
 Create a typealias for a function type that takes in totalAmount and discount type as parameters. It
 returns the totalAmountAfterDiscount.
 
 Now create a printDiscount function to print the totalAmountAfterDiscount for all discount types. It takes
 function type (typealias) as a parameter:
 
 *Hint*: (Double, String) -> Double
 
 Material: [Programming in Swift: Functions & Types Lesson 7: Functions as Parameters](https://www.raywenderlich.com/28433240-programming-in-swift-functions-types/lessons/7)
 
 Typealias are mentioned some in the video.

 ## Assignment 4: Closure
 Create a closure that calculates the discount. Closures takes parameters as: total amount, discount type and
 subtracts discounted amount from total amount and prints the total amount after discount.

 ## Assignment 5: Map

 ## Assignment 6: Sorted
 Create a (Discount types) dictionary (with discount type and percentage amount). Sort this dictionary from
 highest discount to lowest discount.
 
 *Hint*: Use Dictionary's **sorted**
