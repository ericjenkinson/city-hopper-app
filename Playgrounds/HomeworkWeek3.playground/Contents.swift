/*
  Assignment 1:  Function
  Create a function with 2 parameters: totalAmount and discountPercentage (5%, 10% and so on).
  Calculate the discountedAmount and subtract this from the totalAmount (using formulae above).
  Return the totalAmountAfterDiscount.

*/

/*
  Assignment 2: Function
  Modify the function above to now take in a default discount percentage that will be applied by default to all.
  Hint: Use function overloading.

*/

/*
 Assignment 3: typealias
 Create a typealias for a function type that takes in totalAmount and discount type as parameters. It
 returns the totalAmountAfterDiscount.
 
 Now create a printDiscount function to print the totalAmountAfterDiscount for all discount types. It takes
 function type (typealias) as a parameter:
 
 Hint: (Double, String) -> Double

 Typealias are mentioned some in this video.

/*
 Assignment 4: Closure
 Create a closure that calculates the discount. Closures takes parameters as: total amount, discount type and
 subtracts discounted amount from total amount and prints the total amount after discount.

/*
 Assignment 5: Map
 Take itemPrices. Letâ€™s say the prices of all of these items are to be increased by 50%.
 Multiply each element in an array with 0.5. Print the new item price.

 Hint: Use Array's map method.

/*
 Assignment 6: Sorted
 Create a (Discount types) dictionary (with discount type and percentage amount). Sort this dictionary from
 highest discount to lowest discount.
 
 Hint: Use Dictionary's sorted

/*
 Assignment 7: Enums and Switch cases
 Use enums for discount types.
 Create a function printDiscount to print the value for discount types. Use switch cases and enums to do this.

/*
 Assignment 8: Computed property
 Create a computed property: currentDiscountedAmount that returns the current discounted amount that
 you apply on the itemPrices.

 Assignment 9: Lazy property
 Create a lazy property that returns the maximum discount that can be applied.

/*
 Assignment 10: Method
 Create a method that calculates and returns totalAmountAfterApplyingDicount.
 
 Hint: Method belongs to a class/ struct/ enum.

/*
 Assignment 11: Protocol
 Create a protocol and class conforming to the protocol. For example: Discount that has DiscountType and
 DiscountPercentage and a method to calculate discount.
