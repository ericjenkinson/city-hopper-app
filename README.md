#  City Hopper

## About the app.

City Hopper is an app that allows the user to select one or more cities to visit. The 
trips can be planned for a single user or a group. Users will be able to choose cities 
to visit and add them to a trip planning list. Users can write reviews on the cities
they have visited and upload pictures from their trip.

## What is in this week's homework. (branch homework/week03)

The app has two screens at this time. A home screen where the user lands after starting the app.
And an Onboarding Screen that provides a little information about the app. The Onboarding screen
is displayed as a modal sheet when the user clicks Folder button on the home screen. The user
can dismiss the Onboarding screen by clicking the "Return to App" button.

A Swift Playground was added to the project called Homework/Week3. This playground has work for
the thirteen assignments that required for week3. These week's assignments laid the foundation for
apps shopping cart feature.
